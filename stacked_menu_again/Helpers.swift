Pour in the olive oil until it is shimmering and almost smoking. Add the garlic, anchovies, onions and capers and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the onions are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Pour in the wine and bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer until the wine has almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes."
